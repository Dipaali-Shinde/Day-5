      A book is a medium for recording information in the form of writing or
      images, typically composed of many pages (made of papyrus, parchment,
      vellum, or paper) bound together and protected by a cover.[1] The
      technical term for this physical arrangement is codex (plural, codices).
      In the history of hand-held physical supports for extended written
      compositions or records, the codex replaces its predecessor, the scroll. A
      single sheet in a codex is a leaf and each side of a leaf is a page. As an
      intellectual object, a book is prototypically a composition of such great
      length that it takes a considerable investment of time to compose and
      still considered as an investment of time to read. In a restricted sense,
      a book is a self-sufficient section or part of a longer composition, a
      usage reflecting that, in antiquity, long works had to be written on
      several scrolls and each scroll had to be identified by the book it
      contained. Each part of Aristotle's Physics is called a book. In an
      unrestricted sense, a book is the compositional whole of which such
      sections, whether called books or chapters or parts, are parts.
